## Overview

**Project Title**: Password Manager

**Project Description**: A simple password manager that allows users to securely store, view, and delete passwords using basic encryption techniques. The program encrypts passwords before saving them to a file and decrypts them for display when needed.

**Project Goals**: Implement encryption and decryption for password security.
Allow users to add, view, and delete passwords via a menu-driven interface.
Store encrypted passwords in a file for persistent storage.
